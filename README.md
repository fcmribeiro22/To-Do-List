## Introduction

This project serves as a practical demonstration of various web development techniques. The goal is to create a feature-rich Todo List application that allows users to manage tasks within different projects.

## Features

- Create and manage projects to categorize your tasks.
- Each task (todo) includes:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Due Date
  - Priority
  - Checklist
- View all projects and their associated todos.
- Persist data using the Web Storage API, specifically `localStorage`.
- Keep your data organized and accessible across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) - A JavaScript library for date and time manipulation.
- Web Storage API (localStorage)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project folder in your code editor.

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to launch the Todo List application.

## Usage

- When you first open the app, you'll have a default project to start adding todos.
- Click on projects to view and manage their todos.
- You can create new projects and assign tasks to specific projects.
- Mark to-do's as completed.
- The application automatically saves your data to `localStorage`, so your todos persist even after refreshing the page.
